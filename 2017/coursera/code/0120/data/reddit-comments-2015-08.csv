"I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to. It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR. Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving, .2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage. My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points? I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR. Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round?"
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon. There's no way to enforce it. An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check. A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place. No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway."" They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius. Your bullshit proposal is **NOT ENFORCEABLE**. This is why people without 

&gt;Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons? That doesn't convince you? IDGAF.

We already fucking have that. What aren't you understanding about this?! It's just currently not available to private sellers. I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory.

&gt;You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith.

As a gun owner who has harmed no one and has constitutionally protected rights, I actually don't own the anti-gun side a damn thing. It's people like you that convince me to not give an inch at all. I'm wiling to extend NICS to private sellers as voluntary. Take it or leave it, because it isn't going to be made mandatory. Not gonna happen. Period."
"They don't get paid for how much time you spend building your army. They get paid when you gem it. Having a premade layout saves what, 30 seconds? During that time they've made $0 and still have the ability to make $X if you decide to gem it. "
"I dunno, back before the August update in an A+ lobby for Tower Control in Saltspray Rig, I remember the enemy team barraging us with bombs in a suspiciously coordinated fashion.  And my teammates were also tossing bombs left and right.  Non-stop splat/suction/burst bombs.  Bombs, bombs fucking everywhere.  It was terrifying having to dodge one after the other.  It never ended, and some of them even had bomb rush to toss even more goddamn bombs.

I think I still have PTSD of that horrifying event.  That match really felt like a Michael Bay movie."

"Implement some form of tenure for mods and require a majority vote to remove any tenured mod. Only allow mods to trigger a removal vote on mods lower than them in the hierarchy however.

This removes the possibility of a single mod (such as an absentee top mod) swooping in and blowing up the sub but doesn't create opportunities for hijacking. Importantly, it also doesn't require rejiggering the existing mod hierarchies or ongoing admin involvement in dispute resolution."

"&gt;Baltimore County prosecutors will speak to the victim's family before deciding whether to charge Shattuck, reports the station.

Earlier the parents said: 

&gt;""What she did to my son is heinous. The fact that she paraded her pedophilia in front of her own son is even more disturbing,"" the mother said. ""Any adult who rapes a child deserves to be in prison. Please hold her accountable.""

It seems like they probably will ask that they send her to prison. I hope they do. Honestly that judge basically gave the green light to any adult woman to molest little boys free of consequence in the future and that's simply not acceptable.

"I think you might be missing my point. A gun is a tool which allows you to kill very efficiently. Not having those around means there's less chance for people to make dumb decisions which end up in deaths. I'm not concerned with spree killers or other people who plan to kill, I'm concerned with people who wouldn't otherwise put other's lives at risk when they get angry, but there's a gun at hand. The latter is vastly more common than the former."

"Im Dutch and have watched all Netherlands games for the last few years, Nigel de Jong has been solid during the WC and before and I see no reason at all not to include him since we don't have any non attacking midfielders in our team other then Anita (which I don't really rate) and Blind (who we'll probably need as LB). Tete hasn't even been that good in the eredivisie IMO, so why put him ahead of a expierenced player in the Dutch squad like Janmaat is beyond me.  We don't have a real LB in the squad, only Blind and Kongolo (who didn't play well in a weak eredivisie last season) so that's why I would include Pieters.
   I'm not making assumptions here. I agree that our defense hasn't been that good, that's why I don't get why we don't use Nigel de Jong, that's why I wouldn't use young unexpierenced players like Riedewald and Tete. These matches are super important, we won't qualify if we don't win them, so if you want to experiment with other players I would always use more expierenced players and not players who played with each other before instead of new ones like Tete, Riedewald and Anita.

"Don't


Just take them before/after.


I take PreparE before going out and RecoverE on the come down and my rolls have always been pleasant and my comedowns minimal.  Both can be found on [ravesafer.com](http://www.ravesafer.com)


If you really must take some in with you, the PreparE pack only has 3 pills in it (all of the supplements are combined into these 3 pills), so it's far easier to get them into places than having all the supplements separately.

"&gt; Key word there is ""were"". As I nodded to when I said ""Yeah, back in 1960"".

Which is what I referred to. I pointed out the *history* of the use of nullification logic.

&gt;Guess what? This isn't 1960. It's 2015, 

And so what? So people don't have bad idea? A bigot won't use the same logic to refuse to convict? If it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a drug charge"" it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a rape charge"".

[Here's](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/indiana-law-force-cops-overturned-mans-battery-officer-charge/) a case where a man slamming his house's door against an officer's foot was deemed legal because the officer didn't have probable cause to investigate his house.

&gt; But the appeals court reasoned that, “Constable Webb had entered Cupello’s apartment without consent, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or exigent circumstances. Because Constable Webb resisted Cupello’s subsequent attempts to close the door, Cupello had a reasonable belief that force was necessary to terminate Constable Webb’s unlawful entry into his apartment.”"

"I think *M* is one of the most interesting early sound films. Fritz Lang really made incredible use of sound, especially for a director who had predominantly done silent films at the time. Much of the film is completely silent which adds to the suspense for me and the anxiety that the film creates. There's never really a wasted sound clip, every line of dialogue is extremely important. Even Peter Lorre's whistling is integral to the plot."

At least candidates like Clinton or Bush have the political muscle to get what they say done. "

The big discussion was about Arsenal - and Arsenal don't have that physically imposing midfielder other teams do"
"It's why these ""roles"" that Smite have are really fucking annoying when more unique gods enter the game.

Smite  gods are lumped in the different pools where roughly the same items are bought, with roughly the same playstyle and are put in roughly the same lanes, with few exceptions."

It's all dependent on what kind of effect you want really. In terms of summoning or buffing. I prefer summons since they actually do really decent damage and clear maps very well if you have an acceptable range. Therefore, Murgoth is probably the best summoned soul or magnificent Magnus (which is also a summon). Prefixes usually determine what type of stat they will have. So for example A **clever** ""soul"" will provide the int stat or a **potent** ""soul"" will provide attack damage. Specifically for a xenon you probably want a **flashy** soul since it gives an all stats boost if you can't manage to find/buy a magnificent soul."

"F striker is all about close combat and high damage combos, F nen is about ranged attacks and support, f grappler is holds and crowd control. Out of curiosity, what level did you get your f brawler to, I have actually found mine to be quite a lot of fun most of the way through.

In terms of which of those is the most fun to level, for the average person its probably going to be grappler. Striker does not really become fun until you get lightning dance at level 40, and nen is probably going to be completely boring to you until you get a bunch of cube skills (what this will mean to you is different per player). I personally have enjoyed my f nen all the way through (currently sitting at 82), it helps a lot early on to supplement with sand splash and low kick, converting them to magic damage with the conversion option."
"Thanks to the despicable Judge Stephen Williams for explaining why our system of law is dog shit and our system of checks and balances is horribly broken in this document.

&gt;One judge in Friday’s appellate ruling went so far as to defend the NSA’s right not to reveal whether a plaintiff had actually been spied on or not. “Plaintiffs complain that the government should not be allowed to avoid liability simply by keeping the material classified,” wrote Stephen Williams. “But the government’s silence regarding the scope of bulk collection is a feature of the program, not a bug.”

Which should bring to mind an older, relevant document.

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But **when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**"
"That is a pretty rude answer. He didn't say that he wants doyalst answers only that immediately banning people doesn't really help anyone.

I much prefer watsonian discussions but there are times dolayst information has a place as well. If we had a spoiler tag we could use to put that under it would be the best of both worlds. The information could be presented in the relevant location but those who want a purely watsonian argument don't have to be interrupted with it. Also there is no logical reason to ban meta discussion involving multiple settings. Again that leads to great discussions. Being a mod you can either work with the community or for yourself. Maybe you should consider what you want to do. "
"It's true that vaccines aren't 100%.  No medication or medical procedure is 100% safe.  There is a risk that some people's bodies will ""overreact"", similar to an allergic reaction.  It's extremely rare, but it is a risk.  There is also a slight risk if the vaccine was stored improperly and bacteria infected the vile (this happens more frequently today because anti-vaxx advocates pushed for eliminating preservatives from vaccines because of misinformation about the preservatives on the internet, particularly thimerosal).

&gt; Lastly, doctors are not scientific leaders. They take the position of being told what to do and are, from day one, under the control of the drug manufactures.

It's not just doctors that agree vaccines are safe, it's the entire scientific community, because the scientific evidence is overwhelming and there has never been a scientifically verified reproducible study that has shown there is a significant danger to any vaccine in use today.  Period.

Millions of people take vaccines, and people who take vaccines are no more likely to develop any type of condition than those who don't."

"I am testing the mods atm, will post my impressions here.

1. The armor plates mod seems balanced to me, not overpowered.

2. Azimuth's oxygen generators are 1x1x1, this is almost OP. I'd rather had them 1x1x2. Haven't tested the tank volume and the oxy generator performance yet.

3. I tested this wake bomb and fell in love with it. It's requires completely different approah to bombing, as well as skill and luck. Not OP but fun as hell. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354194728

4. Azimuth batteries are, in my opinion, OP, as well as their ""fusion"" reactors. Totally destroys the balance, irregardless of the resourse cost.

5. The ""armored"" thrusters look much better, provide the same amount of thrust, and the additional ""armor"" is almost non-existent. Can take a couple more gatling bullets, so not OP, but look much better and should make it into vanilla game. **Large ship armored thrusters require to be adjusted to the latest vanilla game rebalance!**

6. RCS thrusters are very good, should be in vanilla game too. Excellent for precise docking maneuvers, useless for anything else.

7. Accumulators and capacitors are great and seem balanced to me! Accumulators work like batteries that can store more energy, but their output is weaker. Could be great for storing solar energy in bases and large ships. Capacitors are the opposite: very low storage, but can provide big current, thus compensating for intermittent overloads. I checked the storage and output values vs battery volume. The 1x1x1 mini battery is fine, but the slim battery is a little underpowered and needs to be adjusted.

8. Afterburner is a very interesting concept, although, the implementation could be better. I'd like to have those in the game, and I even considered making a similar mod myself, but there is already an existing one.

9. The solar batteries mod I suggested includes centered panels as well. I checked the power output vs surface vs the vanilla panels. Big ships panels provide exactly the same power/surface area, and the small ship panels are just slightly less efficient.

"If your energy is effected that severely, your daily calories are probably below your [Basal Metabolic Rate](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tools/bmr-calculator). 


1. My BMR is 2064 cal/day, and I want to loose about 1.5 lb/week. 
2. I calculated my TDEE as 2477 (1.2 x BMR) since my job is sedentary. 
3. Now I want to lose 1.5 lb/week (1.5 lb/wk * 3500 lb/cal = 5250 cal/wk), but if I cut my diet by 750 (5250/7) cals/day to 1727 cal/day, I'd be below my BMR and very lethargic (like you describe). 
4. Instead I do about 2500 cal/wk of cardio and cut my diet to 2080 cal/day, just above my BMR.
5. My net calories per week is something like: (Food - TDEE) * 7 - Cardio = Deficit (2080-2477)*7-2500 = -5279 (close enough to my goal of 5250)

Hope this all makes sense! Let me know if you'd like another example with your numbers?

"&gt; I'm a pro-lifer and I don't consider myself a social conservative.

Well that's fine and dandy that you don't consider yourself one; you *do* hold a social conservative view on at least one issue.

"The ONDP targeted their messaging at blue-collar non-Toronto Ontario. The OLP successfully painted that as a move to the right, and continually claimed that they had produced the most progressive budget in history.

That's why the ONDP kept their vote and seat totals basically even, while seeing it shift away from Toronto. That's why people like Jonah Schein lost their seats. (Tellingly, it was the MPPs with unimpeachable leftist bona fides who survived, like Cheri DiNovo.)

The subsequent programme of the Liberals in government, however, has been radically neoliberal, stepping up attacks on unions and kicking the pace of privatisations into high gear. Anyone gullible enough to believe the hype about the OLP's supposed outlefting the ONDP has has learned the error oh their ways, and I don't think they're gonna fall for it this time when Trudeau tries it."

"Because a Google search for how to do Aetherial Reduction lead me here only to tell me ""Hey! you should do that thing you're trying to figure out how to do! gl buddy!"" ...Not OP's fault, but in case anyone else ran into this frustration...

Here's how you do it:

1. Find an ephemeral node. I farm furrymints in Twinpools W. Coerthas from 12a - 4a for example, but they're on a timer all over the new areas. [There's probably a guide somewhere.](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ephemeral_Nodes)

2. Switch on the Collector's Glove action before digging/hacking. It's in your actions list.. the hand by the square/pyramid thingy. It's a permanent thing that stays on.

3. Here's where I was getting confused. Click your furrymint or whatever and it will go to a screen with a 30/30 and it won't let you do jack (which was the point I started doing Google searches and found this thing about how awesome the thing I can't do is)

4. Don't do what I did instead do this.

5. Hit the skill Discerning Eye. Why? Still don't know. Just do it.

6. Now you can hit Utmost Caution skill and maybe some other stuff... again I still don't know what's going on, but it works :p

7. After hitting these cool skills you've had for 2 months without a clue as to what they did you can use ""Methodical Appraiser"" --which is the gather this stuff skill. You'll get something collectible woohoo.

8. Repeat that stuff till the node is empty. 

9. Go to your items, and now those collectibles will give you the option to Aetherial Reduce them.

I know nothing about how to get the best stuff, what the actions do, but it's a start, and it's better than yelling at Google for taking you here for an hour. gl."

"That's a very well explained post, here you have my upvote, fellow colleague. 

Just to clear some things up, I tried to express in the PS that I don't mean every single one of us nor every single legitimate complaint; in fact I said in the first paragraph that I understand them and of course there are things that could be better. My limited english only allows me to explain myself up to a certain point, but the overall point is we are overreacting as a whole, at average, even though there are legitimate complaints and things that could (and should) be fixed/changed.  

And even though some changes were made towards more expending or more time consuming, I think that overall they are giving us much more than they ""took"" from us. We got lots of covers to collect and we complain we can't get them all. We got new modes and we complain they are too time consuming. We got new heroes and we complain we can get them easy. We got new costumes and we complain they won't be there forever. I think you can see the pattern.

Also, sometimes we can't stop believing we have the right to have it all or win it all; I wouldn't expect the game to allow me to be #1 in Battleworld with a team of 4* by only pairing me with teams like mine, the same way people don't expect to compete in real life only with same-category people instead of the whole spectrum (i.e. entering in a top university with a low SAT grade; if you don't have top grades you don't go to top places, I think it's fair). I'm sure the matchmaking could be fixed, but at some point you should be paired with teams better than yours in order to hit a ""wall"" at your class. Btw with 60 wins I'm in the top 5000 for the reward, close to the end, so it's not THAT time consuming I'd say. And then again, it's not like you'll miss a big reward, it's more like ""voluntary"". 

Thank you for your two cents :) I think that we can meet each other in the middle after all ;)"

Unless you're the second coming of the greatest Magic player ever, after playing for a month you have absolutely no clue why certain cards should be in what slot, what the tricks and interactions between cards are, what interactions exist, when it's optimal to play something, when to hold priority to respond to a trigger.

There's so much to it that you're basically jumping into the deep end, because being the person who actually designs the cube really requires and understanding that's a step beyond just understanding how to draft, it's needing to understand how the entire system works together.

"I used to think *Fahrenheit 451* was about censorship too, but recently I learned that it's actually a warning about how TV will make people forget about the written word, and now that I think about it, that's exactly what happened in the book: people chose to get rid of books in favor of TV walls."
"I know exactly how you feel. I want to be able to be open about it so bad, but I live in Louisiana. Which is pretty much one of the worst places to be open about it considering we don't even have decent medicinal laws. (Oil only and for very few conditions) If I was in a state like Colorado I'd have no problem with it. The fact that you're working for a place that receives federal funding really complicates things I feel. It's admirable and right that you'd feel this way, but it's probably for the best that you keep it on the down low for the next year at least. "
"Those ""23 steps"" are only needed in case of a market outage, which is very rare. In all other cases, finalizing is as easy as it was on Agora. So it's a win-win here, if the market is up everything goes smoothly, if the market is down you can still get your coins (unlike centralized escrow)

Also, it is more like 6 steps of copy-pasting, not 23. You know, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. That thing we all learned how to do in the third grade. If a vendor is too lazy to learn how to Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V coins to himself, and would rather have his coins under the control of the market who can exit at any time, then that is his decision.

Additionally, it's difficult to arbitrarily lose your coins in this process, as the console will give you a nice little error notice in red if you screw up Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V'ing something. It's not like your coins will go into oblivion.

Btw, timelocking a 2-of-2? ""Vendors can exit scam with escrow""? You sound like a dumbass... Unless you're trolling, which, congratulations, that is some very good bait"
"Ramos is a decent defender behind the plate.

Gio was sucking even with Lobaton.  Anyways, correlation does not equal causation.

Matt has been alright, considering what he's been given.  He's still a below average manager and he for sure fucked up the series in New York last month."
"I'm definitely considering that scenario and that's why I would link my movement skill to blood magic. Also, ew, that heart and soul cluster. I would feel dirty taking hybrid life/mana nodes when using EB. But I guess it can't be helped."
"Personally, I would prefer this to be an inclusive place for anyone that would like to mock, discuss and document the decay of our capitalist societies.

I would also prefer it to be based in post about real events occuring in the world, new and old, that speaks to that theme. I don't think memes themselves should be featured here, unless they manifest in real life on their own. 

But, I'm not intending to be a despot and I want to hear your ideas. As this is a very new sub I think setting the direction we want earliy and in agreeance with the users we have at this point is key. So please share your ideas and any suggestions. 

At the same time, I don't think it should be a super-serious-all-the-time place either. I would like it to be grounded in real events. With the occasional zesty meme. "
"&gt; Comet storm killing 2 2/1s = RR{1} + 2 kickers, so RR[3].

For Comet Storm to kill 2 X/1's, it only needs to be kicked once, for RR[2]. You get one target just for casting the spell normally. In fact, for killing any number of X/1's, Comet Storm will cost the same as Rolling Thunder.  Comet Storm comes out ahead when you want to deal more than one damage to multiple targets."
"With respect, I think you're putting way too much interpretation in the comments from the story.

I mean, we don't need actual force for rape - if you're passed out of otherwise unable to give consent you can't consent.  Yes, we're being fucked in this in the both drunk, or ""she had one drink"" type bullshit, but rape is the absence of consent for sex...easy and simple.

The prosecutor's comment isn't supportive of changing one's mind after the fact - their prosecution hinged on whether or not she went to the party to have sex, she could still choose to not consent when the situation actually presents itself.  I see no argument that she should be able to change her mind after the fact.

And of course the parents of the little snowflake are going to stand up for their little snowflake.  They're not going to come out an issue a statement telling the world their daughter is a stupid bitch for even going, or wanting to fuck before the party.  Its irrelevant to the story, because every parent will act like that if they believe their snowflake was actually raped.

I do think that this guy probably got fucked by the system (shocking, I know) - but realistically, many of your complaints about the story otherwise seem unfounded.  Just my two cents."
"I second FTL. You'll love it. Guaranteed.

I'd also recommend 'No More Room in Hell' - it's a free Source engine title about survivng from zombies. Despite it's mixed rep, I love it. There's no P2W at all, and it's great for a laugh with a few friends. I regularly return to it with a friend, and it's just great banter.

Not sure if it's considered 'mainstream', but I'd highly recommend the original Metro 2033 if you can get your hands on it (Humble Bundle usually give it away free every year or so). Stellar story, gameplay, and a great title to burn through and enjoy. They released 'Metro Redux', which is 2033 remastered and it's sequel Last Light in a bundle pack. I haven't played the Redux version of 2033 other than a quick jam because I bought the bundle for LL Redux, but they've changed it up too much for my liking. Metro Last Light Redux is fine as there's not much in the way of remastering given it was released so close to the Redux-ing."
"Back in the 90s I remember listening to The City Sleeps by MC 900 Foot Jesus, while driving on a windy forested road at night. Definitely have me goosebumps. Maybe a bit cheesy now but I still dig it. 

Also, I wrote it in another comment, the album Maxinquaye by Tricky fits your requirements exactly. From the opening drum. It's eerie dark and beautiful. "
"Who in the Hell did Bobby Jindal think he was by attempting to dictate what ANY President addresses in their speeches?  He needs to know his place in this country.  Governors do NOT dictate to any U.S. President.  

President Obama was correct to ignore Jindal's request given the damage that climate change has inflicted upon Lousianna, particularly New Orleans."
"If you are connected to the repeater you will experience a drop in speed about 50%.  You'll probably also interfere with other networks around you so as well which will also hurt the quality of the connection. But the upside is that you will have a connection in your room.

You can always try buying you own router and see how that works out. I'd recommend something of quality if you are in a super-congested area (which sounds like you are). Buy something like an ASUS RT-AC66U, put your current modem into bridge mode, and connect the router to that. With some high-quality Ethernet cable that is long enough you should be able to move the router to a more favorable position and have a better signal overall."
"I don't have *that* much of an issue with them, other than the fact that they are apparently buff albino handsome Squidwards... I away saw them as abstract elephantine biomechanoids, like how Giger designed them. 


But I do like how they created the xenos, I always though the xenos were artificial in origin."
"That's what I don't understand. You know that all you have to do is stand behind minions to not get grabbed and yet you still just stand in the open and let Blitz pull you under tower and then complain that he's OP.

I know a lot of times people in low elo are making mistakes like that because they don't know what to do, or they don't know how to deal with a certain ability or champion, but when you know what you're supposed to do (which it seems everyone does with Blitz) and then you still don't do it I just don't understand that."
"Fritz 13 is funny when you play it. ''So das ware die schach.''

I use scid vs PC and load houdini 1.5 on it. It's simple, easy to use for when I want to follow a top game to see whats going on when my frail mind can't handle it."
"Personally, I use after effects.  Don't quote me on it, but I was under the impression that flash is a vector-based animation program.  I used AE because it's an animation and compositing program that works with vectors, rasters, and is built to be friendly with 3D programs.  I know nothing about toonboom."
"For gaming, and particularly MS FSX, you want a stronger CPU. Intel is more recommended for what you're doing. Also 8gb of RAM is more than enough for a gaming machine right now.

I swapped some parts out for others that are faster, higher quality and better for the money.

"My interpretation: Gom Jabbar is an ancient non-Latin incantation in HPMORverse which Draco just happened to have researched in old dark tomes, and far predates the writings we're familiar with. 

Frank Herbert somehow picked up on the phrase, either overhearing it in passing or perhaps by having some actual knowledge of the magical world (e.g. magical relative or somesuch)."
"We do need to significantly decrease the amount of lords. Or find a new way of appointing them. I've always favoured the idea that professional bodies could nominate their own representatives (ie: the General Medical Council, the Royal Society, Institution of Engineering and Technology, various charities, even the Conservative and Labour Parties themselves for political lords.) to hold a position in the House. So they're real technocrats with years of experience that are willing to represent both the interests and knowledge of their organisations in a legislative capacity.

Bit of a pipe dream, though."
"A jumper at my DZ landed herself in a coma with brain damage during an out landing.  It was definitely due to an unforced error on her part, and landing out is something you should always be prepared for cause sometimes it *is* the better option, but lets not pretend like there's never anything to it."
"Makes me sick when I see people say Anti Vaxxer's are an example of ""Natural Selection"" and they deserve it. No one deserves to have their kids paralyzed from polio. This website's top comments show that no one cares about trying to get anti vaxxers informed or preventing disease. they just want to be intellectually superior and mock."

"i don't need to re-read your comment where you misunderstand the proposition and suggest that it would be *less* confusing to provide a completely separate keybind that duplicates the function of something that could be handled by one key with a 3rd option. i already read that stupidity and understood how wildly off base you were - that's why i stepped in to call you insane.

your solution is to provide ANOTHER ball cam key... lol. PSYONIX PLS HIRE THIS GUY FOR GREAT CROSS PLATFORM UI/UX."
"From the male side. Dating another INTJ is a very unique proposition. Being with a woman you can respect for her brain and character is something not many men get to experience. There is immediate understanding, ability to work through issues with nearly no effort, and discussions almost always end with the satisfaction of having found a solution.

There are only 3 things to check, from my experience and reading comments here and elsewhere: 

(a) are both people mature enough to enjoy investing in the relationship and dedicating it some time? If not it will fizzle out.
(b) are both people stable (i.e. no personality disorders)? - INTJ life is hard, many of us carry baggage which can be destabilizing; baggage which is transparent until the moment one gets into an intimate situation with another person and there are feelings on the line.
(c) is there limbic system attraction and can it be sustained. This involves both taking care of the looks department (very hard when you are in the middle of a project) and also just having some traits particular to your gender that keep the lower brain layers of the other person ""on board"" with the plan. Possibly in (c) there is a lot of variability, going from people who couldn't care less about anything other than intelligence (mostly INTP-land), to people who want a more complete package (towards ENTJ land). "
"The Seattle Opera has these.  They're at the back of the upper balcony so the view isn't great, but the speakers mean you can at least hear just fine, but no one can hear you.

I know this because if you feel sick they'll let you use them as well, especially since very few people bring kids to the opera in the first place.  That way you can cough or moan and not bother people who paid $600 for their seats or what-have-you."
"&gt; They did it without paywalls and also without excessive tracking and advertisements.
&gt;

&gt; Then Google came in

Youtube did not have advertising (or even revenue) until *after* google bought it. They were a startup quickly burning through cash, and google bought them for the audience and tried to make it sustainable. "
"I'm not sure - I only know that a while back I tried to link to the Express (to point out how terrible it was) and my comment was auto-deleted. Which is probably why this post links to an archived version, rather than the page itself."
"It will likely go on to your final destination.

If you bag arrives in the final destination airport before you,  it will be in baggage claim then put back somewhere.  You'll need to claim it though an office.  "
"H blademaster is generally pretty bad for assa, I'd suggest grabbing normal class trinket/ heroic censer if those are available to you. Now that you have 4set, your uptime on envenom should be extremely high, specially during execute phase, so you'll definetly see a significant increase in dps on certain fights (gorefiend, tyrant, etc.). 
Now, to the logs: On the reaver kill your popped your CDs before bloodlust. Again, I've said this today, this is only a small dps loss for rogues compared to other classes but it is still a dps loss. I do however believe this was due to lust being popped late and not you misplaying, but do keep this in mind. 
About combat, I do suggest using blade master + soul cap on iskar and xhul like i said a couple comments earlier, tho I'd use soul cap + class on advanced trash. I wouldn't play combat on council, specially considering your OS is assa, which is even better than sub for council. Combat is probably the worst spec, it's all ""fluff"" damage since gurtogg is the real prio. Hope it was useful advice, your logs look solid overall. 
"
"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't care about the aim assist but holy crap I like to play on high sensitivity so I can have an advantage on other players but I can't do that when this bull shit sniper scope moves around so damn fast. "
"Dragon Quest VI... It's okay. I've been marathoning the DQ series for the first time, and was really excited to get to VI since it brought back the vocation system. I'm having fun mixing abilities onto characters...but the story so far has been utterly boring and confusing. None of the characters are very interesting either. Coming off of V, this is a big let down. Otherwise, I'm still kinda having fun exploring stuff and I think that's what DQ does best; gives you a semi-open world to explore.

Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii)... I've needed to play it for a long time and I'm finally making my way through it. I really want to give this game a 10/10 because of the spectacle of it all; it can be breathtaking...but I can't. The story is a bit slow right now though I'm positive it'll get better. The characters seem pretty cool. But the gameplay...it feels like there's way too many systems going on. Affinity with NPCs, Affinity (coins?) with party members, Skill links, Party Gauge, Chains, Gem creation, random items scattered all over the ground for idk what reason, getting equipment drops with totally different stats and some being slotted or perma-slotted, weird targeting system, the whole random ""Press B for a morale boost, whatever that does!"" in battle... it feels like it's too much yet none of it totally goes over my head so I'm still enjoying it all. Also Gaur Plains theme is probably the best video game song ever made."
"Either way there's gender disparities, gender issues involved. Predicated on the fact women feel the need to be more attentive since they fear/will be seen as less than they are (even unconsciously) and guys who feel it's not masculine, that it's weak (so, feminine) of them to *have* emotional and mental health problems. "
"I still can't play a single game without the game crashing. I can't even alt-tab after that and have to either restart the pc or use Win + R to use taskkill (completely blind because i just see a black screen). 

Also the input lag is horrible and somehow my settings are always reset when i start the game (when it crashes + when i close it normally). So i also have to set everything to reduce the stupid input lag...

I have no idea how the XB and PC beta are so horrible after the really good PS4 beta...

Specs: I5-4590, R9 390, 8GB RAM, Win 10 Professional"
"As someone who introduced it to my GF, I'd recommend taking it at her pace. Dota2 can be overwhelming, because there's so much to learn. Let her do the tutorials, watch the vids (just youtube it, there's some great ones), watch the International with her, with commentary. They're great to explain, rewind and explain. GL"
"Even stopping to take photos, sightseeing along the way, keeping up a conversation with a friend. I'd be bored as fuck doing it for that long. At my slowest dawdle I walk at 3 miles an hour. Slowing down beyond that I just can't fathom. "
"Well, considering that even a diamond can be broken with a head-on collision with a bullet, the homeworld likely couldn't fight earth's armies head-on.
If the homeworld had tanks or artillery, or something of that sort, pack your bags."
"&gt; bringing it up just comes off as a stab against AJ

Because at this point this is the only thing WWE cares about. They've always been petty when it comes to bad terms with former employees. They would never acknowledge AJ and use her time with the company and her friendship with Paige on a storyline."
"http://imgur.com/QIeXtFD.jpg
I'm not trying to be greedy or anything but winning this would be nice. My specs are kinda shit tier but decent with an i5-2300, GTX 750 Ti and 8 gigs of RAM(couldn't download anymore ram). Sorry for the crusty pic and dusty pc but anyway thanks for the giveaway/congrats to whoever wins if I don't."
"Entitlement is a bitch huh. Poor people probably feel like they have a right to the contents of my savings account and retirement fund too.

After all it's fucking bullshit that I'm just leaving that money sitting there unspend."
"I don't mind thinking through an at-bat. David Cone does it on YES often, but seemingly every other sentence from Curt's mouth begins with *I*. We know you were a pitcher, Curt.     
He can discuss pitch sequences, locations and the like without constantly reminding us that he used to play the game.

"&gt; Ironically I'm raised eastern and western, so I've grown up with an amount of fan service as you'd expect, but I notice it more and more the past 5-6 years than ever before because its somewhat exploded into popularity.

It seems we have similar backgrounds from that standpoint.

&gt;I think we hit a good middle ground honestly. Its not often on reddit you can discuss something without hurling abuse about

Completely agree. Great talking to you, and good luck on whatever development project you got going. "
"Full casters. I'm a huge fan of glass cannons and the like. As such, I prefer Sorcerers, Wizards, Warlocks, etc. and all their prestige and alternate-type classes. I grew up playing these types of games with my dad, who was either a paladin, big-ass fighter, or barbarian, so he always wanted a ranged fighter to help deal damage, and I always liked magic over physical prowess. 

This being said, I've been looking into Kineticist, so we'll see if I change a bit. "
"My game installed very quickly, that white bar before you even start the game you see in the PS menu. Yes because I figured the online servers are not online yet seeing as the game should not be out yet."
"At the risk of sounding like an asshole, isn't that kind of the point of having a new generation? Support for previous gens has to stop at some point. Can't really advance in the industry if you're still concerned with older technology.

Mortal Kombat 9 is on PS3/360. If you own an older system you have to get used to playing older games."
"That's kind of a weird song to defen. I mean, they literally said they hated generic pop (not that I don't love that song, but it isn't what most people who consider an example of ""the musical decline"")"
"Hmm, this may be a bit risky, but you could buy all the stuff first and then conduct a session with potential members. Then if they like the session and want to join the club, charge a membership fee. I don't know the college club that doesn't have a member fee. Usually like 15 dollars"
"Is there a UserVoice suggestion for it? If not, there should be. If we could get the votes of all the people who come to this sub, it would definitely make an impact. Now, I could create one and link to it here, but I don't want it to come off as some kind of voting scheme or anything."
"I couldn't agree more with your armor suggestions. Btw I am a huge fan of Army of One of the shotgun. So many times I have gotten a kill to juice my grenade recharge just in time for either a post-mortem or at the very least clutch chain damage.

edit: completely skipped over subclass design sections.... good work."

Once realized, we didn't let her have them alone, but N only escalated abuse towards the family, and eventually chaos ensued.  If I had realized when they were babies that N was still N-ing at others, I would not have let her near them.   I wish I had.

We raise ""family"" relationships to almost holiness in this country.  If it is a good family, yes, have relationships with them.  But if what they are going to teach your child is that the child is worthless, or to be selfish pigs like N, or any other nastiness, then RUN AWAY.  "

That's right, those of you playing at home, what if this movie is going to be ground work for a second movie to take us to central America to explore/destroy those temples? We know from Liberation that the Templar are excavating a Mayan temple in Mexico to find POE, so something has to push them in that direction, right? "

Even when he got his PC, I thought PC gaming was too expensive. However, I eventually caved. I found a prebuilt ASUS at Best Buy and picked it up. That was a huge regret.

"**Tired of League and wanna try out Dota 2? You just took the first step for a better gaming experience!**

**Here a short^^Kappa list of things you need to know.**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Avoid using League of Legends Terminology

* **Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA""** (CS:GO best ""MOBA"")
* Dota 2 is officially an ""ARTS"" 
* ""Hero"" not ""Champion""
* ""Tower"" not ""Turret""
* ""Creep"" not ""Minion""
* ""Barracks"" not ""Inhibitor""
* ""Ancient"" not ""Nexus"" (Wc3 = Tree and Throne)
* ""Roshan"" not ""Baron"" or ""Nashor""
* ""MMR"" not ""Elo"" (No, it's not the same. Elo = name of the ranking system named after it's creator, MMR = meaning of the shown value ""Match Making Rating"".)

Explanation why Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA"":

* DotA was made on Warcraft III which is an RTS game. Since DotA is basically a modified RTS game the genre was specified based on the genre of the original game, thus making it an ARTS. This is the logical name for it with a clear description and meaning behind it.
* The term ARTS was used before ""MOBA"" was even heard of, but wasn't used as much because DotA was the only game of this kind.
* Why ""MOBA"" doesn't even fit as a genre name: *What competitive game isn't multiplayer, online, and takes on some sort of battle? The first three words apply to nearly every single online game that pits players against each other (obviously). The fourth word, arena, doesn't even describe the DotA/LoL/HoN-genre. Using that word implies an all-hostile area that dismisses the territorial control and lane-pushing among its many facets of gameplay.*

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Before learning Dota 2

* Your rank in LoL doesn't matter when playing Dota 2.
* Don't apply your League habits to Dota 2.
* Be open for everything, there is more than one way to play.
* Your Dota 2 level does not matter and does not reflect your skill.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### General Information

* Every hero is available for everyone. (Different game modes might restrict which hero you can pick.)
* You have a courier which can bring items to you.
* Item's can be dropped, stashed, and some of them can be shared to other players.
* Compared to League, Dota 2 has many activatable items, most of them for utility purpose. 
* You lose gold when you die.
* All units have a turn rate. If you want to turn around with your hero you have to turn first before actually moving. It feels weird at first, but it's really easy to get used to.
* Micro - You move other units by selecting the units you want to move and not by Alt-click like in LoL. Meaning you can also deselect your hero unlike in LoL where your Champ is always selected.
* Mana management is very important. Spells costs way more than in LoL, but they have also a bigger impact when used correctly.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Denying Mechanic

* You can deny your own/allied units with an attack command (A-click).
* You can deny creeps (&lt;50% HP) to reduce the exp the enemy gets and obviously denying potential gold.
* You can deny heroes (&lt;25% HP) who have certain damage over time spells/debuffs on them.
* You can deny towers (&lt;10% HP) to reduce the gold the enemy team receives.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Runes

* Runes are special boosters which give you a certain effect depending on which rune you pick up.
* Runes spawn every 2 minutes on 2 locations on the river.
* There is always a Bounty rune and 1 random non-bounty rune. (Except for game start there are 2 Bounty Runes.)
* No non-bounty rune can spawn twice in a row.
* If a rune is not taken on a 2 minute mark, the rune will change.
* Runes can be stored inside of a Bottle and activated at will for up to 2 minutes before they activate automatically.
* After the rune is being from a Bottle, the Bottle will be refilled with 3 charges.

*The Runes:*

* **Bounty** - Gives 50 + (5 * minute) experience and 50 + (2 * minute) unreliable gold.
* **Double Damage** - Increases base attack damage by 100% for 45 seconds.
* **Haste** - Increases movement speed to 522 for 25 seconds and ignores all slow effects. Can be purged.
* **Illusion** - Spawns 2 illusions that last 75 seconds, and deal 35% damage. Melee take 200% damage, ranged take 300% damage.
* **Invisibility** - Grants invisibility after a 2 second fade time. Lasts 45 seconds.
* **Regeneration** - Grants 100 health regeneration and 67 mana regeneration per second for 30 seconds. Effect ends if hero takes damage, or when both health and mana are fully replenished.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Day/Night Cycle

* Game starts at 0:00 as day time, prior to that it's also day time.
* Every 4 minutes the game time changes (first night at 4:00).
* The game time affects the hero/creeps/building vision.
* Heroes have regular 1800 day vision and 800 night vision. There are exceptions.
* There are spells which affect the game time.
* Moon Shard grants you +250 night vision.
* Aghanim's Scepter for Keeper of the Light will give him unobstructed vision at day while Night Stalker gets unobstructed vision at night.


&amp;nbsp;
***
### Tower Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking a friendly hero with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking the tower itself with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking any friendly unit with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Circumstances for target switch:*

* If the targeted enemy unit or hero goes out of range
* If the targeted enemy unit or hero dies
* If an enemy unit or hero targets a friendly hero
* If an enemy hero being attacked by the tower manually attacks another enemy unit or hero (in which case, the tower will select a new target based on the above priority order).

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Creep Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy lane creeps
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Other behavior:*

* Ordering an attack on an enemy hero will change their aggro onto you.
* Lane creeps can follow you anywhere until they lose sight for a longer time or take aggro by other lane or neutral creeps.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Gameplay

* Dota 2 has no *forced* META like League which tells you to play in a certain way or to go on a certain lane.
* Many heroes can be played in many different ways. Called ""support"" doesn't always has to be a support, same as a ""carry"" can also be played as support. Considering you know what you're doing.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Common Tips

* If you play a hero with an invisibility spell or buy an item with such an ability, don't stand around waiting for an enemy to get low HP for an easy lasthit/kill. Scout the area, gain information and get kills or assist your team.
* Techies Stasis Trap and Remote Mines give vision! Spread them out! Gain vision! Take part in teamfights!

&amp;nbsp;
***
### MOST IMPORTANT

* **Last but not least: Always, and I mean ALWAYS! buy and carry a TP Scroll!!**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Useful Advanced Guides

* Making an *autoexec.cfg* with useful settings, commands and scripts. [Check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xetu/comments/2qivoy/xetus_dota_2_autoexeccfg/)
* Advanced HUD customization for colorblind (and everyone else). [Check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xetu/comments/389q68/guide_advanced_hud_customization_for_colorblind/)

&amp;nbsp;

*That's basically the main things you need to know. Just talk to people that you need some help, ask them what to do and be open for suggestions and tips.*

*If I forgot something tell me and I'll add it.*"
"Agreed but if we use the term delayed it would mean that most major console releases were delayed since they didn't have enough to meet demand. Using the term limited may also be a helpful marketing term that drives up interest due to the perception of scarcity.

HTC may still produce a lot and may be just be trying to cover their bases in case there are problems in manufacturing. I doubt they have an exact number of what will be available until they are made and pass quality control."
"Honestly, try spicebomb. I've used that for years amongst other colognes (margiela jazz club, tom Ford tobacco vanille, and CDG wonder wood) and have always gotten comments on how good it smells. Good masculine scent but not over bearing."
"It's odd to hear what I (and most of my friends) consider a feminist perspective to be spoken as a counter to a supposedly feminist point.

I fully agree with your perspective, but not your characterisation of feminism.

That's the issue with a lot of tumblr satire subs, you miss a lot of the more rational discourse simply by not seeing it.

Case in point, the first result on google for 'Feminist Sex Ed': http://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/what_is_feminist_sex_education 

Emphasises consent and negative effects on men as well as women of poor sex ed, and characterises every feminist perspective I've encountered in the real world rather than online.

Sorry for the ramble, I just get rather concerned that the structure of reddit (and the bias of the default subs) lends itself to an unnecessarily adversarial perspective in regards to feminism.

In this scenario though aren't we talking about someone who used to LOVE Sushi and would talk about it and even get dressed up in Sushi-themed garb in order to enjoy it....Who then suddenly became a pro-fish activist?
"You can easily enjoy BF4 without premium (free night map update comes out September 1). Servers are full but there are many game modes that are dead.(the not fun ones) Premium mainly adds cool new maps, a few good guns and neat little features, I got it for $20 and I think it was worth it."
"From your screenshot; they're already installed. As long as they show up in your DATA folder they'll show up in MO.

They say 'unmanaged' on the left panel because they're in DATA rather than the MO directories, but that's normal. "
"&gt;If you found the gun itself at Zeleno (which is pleasantly surprising, actually), then maybe the ammo can spawn there, too.

"Jealous that she was allowed to have long hair, I was teasing my sister with some large scissors; vertically chomping them with my little 8 yr old arms bellowing in time with the snaps of the scissors, "" I'M going to CUT your HAAAAIR!""....She thoughtlessly grabbed for the scissors on ""HAAAAIR!"" and was sliced to the thumb bone on both sides. We, having no idea what to do and convinced we would both be disowned, tried wrapping the wound with toilet paper and applied some pressure( to keep blood coming out like one stops a leak in a dam). When the wound started dripping, I grabbed a handtowel and wailed for our parents. Mom took her to the ER AND I ""sat on the wall"" for hours convinced I was going to die when mom got home. It was a hard evening, but I was spared. I also try to avoid handing her a pair of scissors."
"I would like to interject with the only somewhat relevant comment that many of you guys on the fitness RP kick are obsessed with extreme fitness (ambition is great) and may be overdoing it on the supplements. You also want to consider the impact on your joints because one day you will be older and you still have to live in your body. Building muscle strength gradually but steadily will reduce your risk of injury.

If you do everything in proportion, you'll still be in the top 5% of game guys in a sea of pudgy manboobs, so don't screw up your long term health for short term gain. Let bitches play the short game and drive into the wall.

Every time read an article on protein the recommendation has gone up. Yes muscles are made of protein, but Your body doesn't need this much damn protein !  If your body doesn't use it all it it turns to ammonia in your frigging blood and it's a toxic load on your body before your kidneys take it out.

Creatine , T+ boosting herbals,wunderbar ! etc but are getting overused. I think these are icing on the cake. Again, if you take too much or take and skip your workout your fucking organs are going be stressed cleaning up this toxic soup at the end of the day.

Also I suspect a lot of people mugatu included take this stuff at the beginning of the day based on the workout they intend to do and don't get to half the time.

You want to take just enough to match your goals gain level, exertion level, you need to take breaks. More beyond this level is stressing your body out.

As (anecdotal single data point allegory)proof I offer the example my friend who trained hard for a endurance race type competition and came in first out of 1000 6 months ago. Combined with the paleo diet.

He's been out for the last month and a half passing kidney stones. Maybe this would be an acceptable trade off for greatness that will give him an alpha boost of poon so he can go die like a rutting moose, maybe it was unnecessary but look at *your* calendar realistically and other commitments decide whether your supplementation is going to get you there.

Mugatu says this out of love as he doesn't want to see you guys on dialysis. "
"Her passive gives her speed, percent health dmg and health back. Its very strong.


She also has HUGE chase potential, much like Riven. If you get a lead, its easy to chase people down because you have a dash, your passives move speed and your ult (which makes you faster around the people you ulted and gives you more opportunities to pop your passive). 

Not to mention her ult is ridiculous if you can manager to get it off.

Her W is kickass too, it reminds me yasuo's windwall. She becomes immune to incoming dmg, and if the dmg was a displacement she has potential to stun her opponent. 

Lots of outplay potential, health back and move speed. "
"actually, dkali is very useful on mono color teams, or more accurately, combo teams too. her unbindability + time extend awakenings are amazing. but it is her skill which makes her, in my opinion, the most versatile sub in the game. 6 turn cooldown board wipe which can be chained in conjunction with the likes of persephone or claire for extra damage. the active can be used for utility for a bind clear if given six hearts, or to stall out hits you otherwise would not be able to heal back up from.

lkali is a bit more limited i think."
On top of this there is also a Catholic Byzantine Empire. A unified Nubia going all the way to Egypt that is still Miaphystite. An Empire of Francia. An Empire of Carpathia that is Sunni. A Catholic Andalusia with a 6 year old Irish King. So much happens when you let everything run unchecked.
Because those sort of comments bring nothing of value to the comment section and people obviously does not like like them. The fact that you have multiple accounts (implying that you replied to your own comment?) doesn't change that fact.
"&gt;Please quote where I said ""We need the initiation of force to solve societal problems"".

Trying to weasel out huh? Statism requires the initiation of force. If you say we need taxes and fiat currency, you are saying we need the initiation of force. If you say we need a government monopoly on certain services, you are saying we need an initiation of force. 

Now justify why we need it. Stop being an idiot. "
"Yeah. I was at the watch party with a lot of my friends and I got so pissed off listening to these two ""fans"" in front of me talk shit about the team. They left with 15 minutes left in the third. When we tied it up, that entire crowd lost it. I was so nervous during that third intermission. I was anxiously dancing. When he scored that goal I about started crying. That was one of the most amazing things I have seen in the playoffs. That moment outdoes any other moment for me, hands down."
I think it's because there are more IT guys on reddit than alot of other occupations for say and there are just alot of people who carry across the US (and a few other countries) so you are bound to see more IT guys carrying as more IT guys post.  I am horrible at wording things but I hope that makes sense.
"I haven't seen any journal that accepts anything without a university or other institute adding their stamp on it, not even arXiv. The work is all my independent and original work, which is why I have an issue with people putting their name on it"
"If this is really for physics, just expand it in an infinite series and you have it easy.  The desire for ""expanded in elementary functions"" is not as helpful as it may seem - most of the important ""functional relationships"" you may look for have derivations using the infinite series.

Or even simpler, expand as an infinite exponential series using the standard geometric expansion of reciprocals.

This is a perfect example of a simple to integrate function that becomes much harder when you are focused on elementary expansions and the standard substitution and by-parts tricks of calculus.  Part of learning physics is learning to ignore all that unnecessary complication and just brute force the solution to make progress."

"Wish it were true-but there is also the category of those that are blatantly racist yet deny it, using the excuse ""Im not racist cos Im Liberal"". I've come across a disturbing number of feminists who claim to be Left wing who also are racist.

Political labels are used like fashion nowadays. But they rarely reflect the person who hides behind them anymore. "

"I don't think cultural libertarians are making any claims as to what a person can do with his property. Instead cultural libertarians are making a statement about the value of freedom of expression in culture and media. While the political libertarian defends the right of a road owner to refuse a political parade, the libertarian with a general support for human freedom, may still take the cultural libertarian perspective that it's good in general to let other people have their say.

"This. I made this very mistake while teaching my fiance to play League. My thoughts were ""losing in league is not fun, therefore helping her improve quickly will make it more fun!"" Instead, all this did was make our gaming sessions frustrating and a source of tension. She did end up getting pretty good, but it's a miracle that she kept playing.

This also depends her personality: someone who plays games to achieve mastery and compete will respond better to coaching than someone who just wants to relax and goof around. This greatly affects your learning style and what motivates you to improve. I'm more of the former, while my fiance is more of the latter. "

Thalassophobia isn't necessarily a fear of things in the sea, its fear of the unknown that you get with the ocean, or even deep, dark freshwater. Sometimes its triggered by predators, sometimes just by the darkness.

"which hype? That she would return in the show? I really really hoped she'd return at the end of the season before last - I thought it would have been a great way to keep the King in the North plot more relevant. The show went a totally different way in the end, and honestly I thought from that point onwards it was on a downward trend. The last season had very few 'great moments', regardless of whether it was coming from the books or D&amp;D. For me the finale this year felt so cheap; it was an old fashioned 'create as many cliff hangers as possible' ending. A glorious post from a few months back said that the show was becoming a parody of the books, and in that episode it definitely felt true. 

Sorry if that was too much of a downer - I'm still looking forward to the next season! The show can recover. "
"In the situation you describe you might get a few extra ones at most. Say you have 3 carpenters and have requested 10 barrels, you might end up with 12 barrels if all 3 were crafting the 10th one.

They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""fedora family"" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself.

The problem with that is that it's more analogous to having interrupts add a 3-6 second cooldown to every single weapon skill instead of 10 seconds to one.  There's not really an easy equivalent punishment for thieves since they depend so heavily on their initiative to survive.

"Speaking of the CDC, they also did research into gun violence and found the same conclusions.  Then, the NRA lobbyists convinced politicians through donations to get further research into gun violence completely banned.

That's pretty telling when a pro-gun group spends money to promote ignorance about gun statistics.

I'm actually quite happy with many of the smoking laws and ordinances that have been passed in the USA.  That's good progress.  I'm also happy the FDA just recently told Cigarette company to stop using labels like ""natural"" on the box.  I'm all for improving public health, and at least in the tobacco realm there has been good progress.  Back in Wisconsin, when I lived there years ago, I actually spent considerable time promoting and supporting causes that led to bans on smoking in places like restaurants, bars, and bowling alleys.  I suppose my family being involved in public health, social work, education, probably helped form me into someone who fights against things that harm people.  Not everyone shares my background.

I guess I'd wonder why someone would be opposed to reducing deaths.  I mean, even if there were stronger restrictions, but not an outright ban, would that not help?  Yet pro-gun people and groups are often vehemently opposed to more stringent background checks, mental health checks, and sales tracking.

If you paid attention, I support statistics, facts, and history of successes for being supportive of a government program designed to protect people.  This should have been a major clue that I do not, in fact, support unlimited government data collection, spying on citizens, and the patriot act.  I think the violations to people's freedoms and privacy are unconscionable in this case.

So while I do not support doing things ""by any means necessary"" but in fact support a fact based, prudent approach, I will continue to hold my stance that fewer Americans should be gun owners in an effort to reduce death from gunfire."

"My parents were die hard Michigan fans, so my first memories of Michigan football were from when I was about 7 years old in the late 80s. And for the longest time I didn't even realize Ohio St. was a significant rival. It sure seemed to me like the season opening game against Notre Dame was easily the biggest game of the year, an annual match up of two top-5 teams. The next biggest game was the Michigan St. game, because there were a decent chunk of my classmates who rooted for them. I didn't realize Ohio St. was any different than all the other Big Ten teams we beat every year on the way to the Rose Bowl until like 1993, when they were undefeated and highly ranked (and we still beat them). 

So, warning to Ohio St. fans: things can change."
"Yes! Well said :D

In addition to this, I feel the village aspect is largely unrecognized/not encouraged in the US society. I'm African-American and was ""raised in the church."" Beyond the 'brothers' and 'sisters' of my home church community (who were effectively mentors and surrogate family members), I was very close to my *actual* cousins, aunties, uncles, and grandparents. Family friends, which included neighbors, parents' co-workers, and my sister and I's close friends' families, also played a heavy and substantial role in my upbringing. Nevermind the teachers, teacher's aides, and other adult leaders of the many extracurricular activities I was involved in over the years. I don't understand how our (US) culture can encourage so many independent thoughts and beliefs to the exclusion of many potentially helpful voices when it comes to raising a *child*!

"Staying home is an individual decision. 

Staying with the person is your decision. 

It takes both of these things to have lived together as a one-income household.  If you don't want to be a one income household, leave. If you stay, you enabled and allowed the lifestyle to happen. 

The other person gets alimony if the lifestyle of a one income house hold was previously had. If you left, then there wasn't a one-income lifestyle, because a lifestyle requires living together. 

If you decide the relationship is worth it to you to stay, then *you made the decision to stay in that lifestyle and therefore are responsible for that decision.*"

"&gt;  Israel's hand ~~was always sent out for peace~~ they would like to not have every Arab nation trying to kill them an example being the 1948 war where the Arab league attacked and lost. In the rules of law if you attack someone and fail sucks to be you the other side rights the peace. No one rarely cares about the dismantling of the Austrian Hungarian empire, or the German Reich. It is no different here, the Arabs attacked and lost, the changing of borders is entirely on them for losing a war.

"&gt;Personally I'm all for her aborting the pregnancy but she shouldn't be able to abort the child in order to avoid it being tested to establish the her rape victim is the father though.

That is a kind of weird argument, isn't it? First off, I am quite sure a paternity test can be performed on an aborted fetus (sorry, that is a disgusting thing to write). Secondly, imagine being a child who was born in order to prove whether your mother raped your father — being a piece of evidence in a criminal case, so to speak. Can you imagine how such child must feel? It is shockingly unethical.

As for in general whether to take children away from rapist parents; I guess it must come down to individual cases. They would not necessarily be bad parents in *all* cases. The only argument that applies in *every* case would be  that parental cooperation would force the rape victim into persistent contact with their rapist, which we can't have, obviously."
"My assumption would be that as long as the dev community embraces Touch (i.e. allows their controls to be re-mapped for Touch) Oculus will simply replace their Rift + Xbone controller bundle with a Rift + Touch bundle, albeit at perhaps a higher price.  They'll possibly also have standalone Rifts at that point.

"Make sure to bake keyframed moving elements in C4D. sometimes, interpolation between keyframes can be slightly different in C4D than Ae, making it out of sync. Also make sure framerates are correct. Do you use .AEC files?"
"I don't think intuition is categorically better than sensing. Sometimes you need a concrete focus on reality in life. I find sensors tend to be better than intuitives at doing careful and precise work, especially xSTx types. It's the xSFx types that, in my personal subjective opinion, are totally worthless human beings. Their biggest strength seems to be socially conforming obedience - strength through cohesive numbers.   "
"Well, I'm inclined to say: *why not both?* ;-)

I know what you're getting at, but provided you recognise experiences for what they are (peak and mundane it's all the same), then you are fully free to enjoy them, since you realise you *aren't* them fundamentally. That even includes having fun by being a bit of a dick in an argument now and again.

Perhaps it's not what you mean, but surely pursuits of power are only ""distractions"" if you think you are separate from the world and that one part will overcome the other? In exactly the same way as ""seeking"" is a distraction. So long as you don't mix up the narrative with some sort of ""development"" - you have understood that although you may change, you never progress - it's okay I reckon."

"Cause it is. Warcraft lore has always been hammy, but it hasn't been as outright lazy as it was in this expansion. It's really exemplified by Grom's sudden turn to heroic character at Hellfire Citadel, when the entire rest of the expansion he was The Threat that we were trying to kill. Like, I don't know how much you follow Game of Thrones, but if Ramsay Bolton decides to help out against the White Walkers you can sure as shit bet that Jon Snow isn't going to just pat him on the back when it's over. And yet how many atrocities did Grom's armies commit against the Draenei with zero provocation? And now everyone's cool? "
"They have pretty good vision actually. In water too with transparent eyelids. They even have great night vision with a layer behind their retinas called tapetum. There was a study in the 60s I read recently which indicated they may be severely farsighted while underwater, compensating with other senses to hunt prey. In open air their eyesight is just fine though as well as having super senses such as detecting pressure waves, temperature variations and chemical stimuli using dome pressure receptors which cover their entire body. In other words they are usually very aware animals of exactly what is going on. The reason I think these are blind is that they weren't able to see where the fish landed at all, they do use visual cues. Usually you can throw a piece of meat at them and they'll snatch it out of the air. "

You would deserve to have your child taken away from you if you let him live in such filth. Sorry but this guy is putrid. It's already animal abuse for your cats to be stuck with your trash husband and the literal dumpster he lives in.

Your statements about your husband being dealt a harsh lot in life and needing a gentle touch are just blah blah blah excuses. They are symptoms, not the problem, and you are contributing by enabling his garbage behavior.

This guy needs to fester in his own filth until he hits rock bottom enough, on his own, he has to better himself. As long as you clean his house and he just doesn't care if it's not clean, nothing will get better and your kid will have no respect for his slob dad. He'll probably never want to invite his friends over so they never see Jabba the Hutt slime trailing his way around the place and make fun of him.

A heart attack at 26? This guy is already dragging you down with him and will rot your life. Separate and tell him if he doesn't better himself and his living conditions, you will divorce in 6 months, 1 year, whatever.

I'm 21 now and since I lost my virginity at the age of 15, sex for the 'lulz and jizzing' is all I've really seen sex for. Upon listening to this show I've really had to think about my reproductive capacity in a new manner. I used believe the whole ""yea it's a biological reaction no different than a turd"" thing back in my 'edgy' teens (thank you extremely liberal upbringing). But even then I've always wanted to get a vasectomy and adopt a child instead which is causing me some internal conflict. I just can't justify creating a new child, not saying anyone is wrong for wanting to go forth with creating their own child as a couple, but I feel that if I can help an unwanted child I'd rather do that. The vasectomy would be to make sure that no pregnancies occur by mistake, but gives that me 'cum obsessed individual that's wasting their reproductive capacity' feel. The fact that I only want to adopt though reminds me that, technically, it'll be wasted anyways. 

Would really enjoy to hear your thoughts on this, and thanks a ton for doin whatcha do."

"I appreciate it! I do have one question about lunges. When I do them, I get very low, into a similar position as the runners starting position, where I can use my pelvis to control how much I stretch, either by pushing down, or flexing my abs for a posterior tilt.

I haven't noticed a lot of improvement in my hip flexors, but that might also be because of a lack of core strength, or simply because I'm not consistent enough in doing the exercises."
"I understand that, but that being the case, there is no need to follow him, or imitate the Apostles as they imitated Christ.

"They need to go after Fortaleza quickly, and hopefully cut Brazil off from further northern expansion.

"A result of the virulent rivalry between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire over the control of Syrian territory surrounding Rafah, this conflict saw Ptolemy IV Philopator, the then Pharaoh of Egypt, battling against Antiochus III the Great. The North African Forest elephants used by Ptolemy IV charged towards their larger Asian cousins at the beginning of the fight but fell back not long after due to panic, causing a bit of disruption and confusion amongst the Egyptian infantrymen. In spite of this setback, the Egyptian phalanxes were able to drive back those of the Seleucids, while some of their cavalrymen pursued Antiochus, distracting him and thus preventing him from gathering his now retreating forces. This would lead to a Ptolemaic victory over the Seleucid Empire and temporary Egyptian control of the region, as well as the capture of the majority of Antiochus' Indian war elephants.

All else aside, this particular part of the Syrian Wars is especially notable for being the only known battle in history in which African war elephants have fought against their Asian counterparts."

Overwatch doesn't really need to change anything because that's what all the other shooters after Overwatch are responsible for. As long as Overwatch nails a relatively simplistic class based shooter with a great competitive scene and really inventive and unrestrictive heroes, they can add neat twists later. "

"The basics? If you're an outsider, you're *not* welcome. You can spend 30 years in Denmark, speak fluent Danish and give no immediate tells that you're not Danish. When they find out, they *will* treat you differently. Well, the majority will. You'll still find open minded people who have no issues with foreigners. 

Also, they are far from the most social, friendly or service minded people you'll ever come across. I've been to Canada many times. Maybe only have a dozen or so, but I've collectively spent months of my time there. I've gotten to know a few Canadians through my trips. Life in Scandinavia is very, very far removed from life in Canada. 

I suggest finding a friend here where you can come and live with them for a short period of time and get to know the place before you decide to make a permanent move. These places can look great when you come for a week or two, but the more you learn about it, the less attractive it might seem.

Everyone is different and my experience of Denmark bares no relation on what your experience of moving to Sweden would be like, but you don't have to look far, even on here, to find Swedes who are as anti-foreigner as the Danes are. Most of the foreigners I've come across in all my years here tell a similar tale of unhappiness. The ones I know who came for work or women stay here, but I know countless people who came for work or study who just leave for somewhere better. Hell, I wouldn't be short of presenting a Dane or two who no longer wants to live here. It's not all rosy. There's *far* worse places that you could be that Canada. I've been in Scandinavia for 8 years and I'd still move to Canada tomorrow if the option presented itself."

"1. Cauldron works in mysterious and dickish ways. They honestly believe in forcing other people to make terrible sacrifices for the sake of their half-precognitive half-random-BS plans. So it's totally in character for them to let a murderer run wild if they think it's part of some path or other.

2. Cauldron is busy. Contessa doesn't have much free time.

3. Cauldron is very secretive. Acting too blatantly would compromise their plans, and maybe even force them to face consequences for all of the terrible stuff they've done.

4. Cauldron isn't invincible. Fanon builds Contessa up to be unstoppable, but she has weaknesses and blind spots. Cauldron's actual onscreen win/loss record isn't great. If Contessa went face-to-face with some parahumans, notably Jack, she might die.

Put it all together and you have a good explanation for Cauldron not targeting people like Mannequin. Chances are they do take out a fair number of murderous capes off-screen, but they've got a lot of reasons not to take out every cape that murders pointlessly."

She knows about it, I got the go ahead first. I was shocked it was happening and she's all, ""Thumbs Up!"" Our relationship is... interesting. 

For me personally, my attraction towards women has diminished. A fair bit of my previous attraction was a sort of visual arousal, but always with this strong undercurrent of, ""wish that was me!"" I'm not terribly shocked that's much lower and now men in the abstract generate more arousal for me than women in the abstract. There are things about guys that now turn me on much, much, more than they ever did. I've never actually been in a straight relationship with a man though."

"Snakes have two phalluses that are completely internal. They are actually totally inverted (inside out) when inside his vent (the cloacal hole that ejects waste in both sexes, and eggs in females), housed inside his body just before his tail starts. When they mate, the male will line his vent up with the female's and evert (turn right side out, so it sticks out of the vent and becomes engorged) one penis, which he then inserts into the female's vent, and transfers his sperm to her. Once he's done, his penis inverts again, inside his vent.

As for birds, their genitals are also internal, but I own snakes, not chickens, so am not up to date on their situation.

Incidentally, some snakes don't lay eggs, and have live births, instead."

"they should really go back to flag neutralization.     

i can see their point,  without flag neutralization,  if you want any chance of winning,  you have to go cap the flag.

with flag neutralization, there was a tendency for some players to leave the uncapped flag neutral and go on killing sprees.

this helps avoid that,  but at the same time, makes it harder to cap and get come from behind victories.

they should either increase the time to cap a flag to compensate for lack of neutralization,  i.e. when it fills up half way the speed of the cap doubles or triples,   or bring back neutralization.

i would prefer the time to be sped up drastically when the meters fills up half way, to make the games more enjoyable and increase the action.

"I was joking, but the last time they dropped out of the CL into the EL (or Uefa Cup as it was) that I remember (15 years or so ago) they went all the way to the final.

I seem to remember last year Wenger saying something along the lines of ""going out 3rd in your group is better than the last 16 as it allows you to continue to compete for a european trophy"" - which may have been him moaning about the situation, but also implies that he takes the EL seriously.

Any of the top 4 PL teams have the strength and depth to win the EL (not saying it's easy, but I definitely think all of our teams are capable of doing it), and doing so will boost the coefficient by a lot. 

"
"lmao.

You're competing with 3rd worlders who live worse then you and they do a better job and you're upset.

So fuck 'em, we'll make it illegal to give them money or business, because I'm white and want a spoiled life.

It's lazy, union-style racism of 3rd worlders who obviously don't deserve a nice life like you through their hard work.

"&gt;What's worse is the housing crisis here is dreadful, Nobody can afford to rent, let alone buy. London is becoming the new monaco, and all the poor people are being pushed out into the home counties. We have no rent controls unlike NYC. Soon enough the infrastructure will completely break down as the cleaners, security guards, starbucks barristers and fast food workers just cannot afford to live here.  
  
This is the convenient fact that people arguing against rent control never want to address.  Where will the service workers live if you just let the market dictate rent with no controls?  My guess is the reason they all simply say something like ""they can live in the suburbs and commute"" is because no economist has to live on $15/hr.  Start paying economists low wages and watch those studies suddenly start championing rent controls.

"No one has said anything but nevertheless here's my side:

I am not anxious about talking to people or showing off what I can do BUT whenever I play in front of others I feel my fingers being a bit more shaky and ""slow"". Usually doesn't happen with singing but I don't get a chance to show that off.

Haven't been in a band yet, so can't speak about live performances and being more into the heavier genres than things like Jazz or pop or whatever open mics aren't an option."
"I agree that mom is just using any excuse to control. But a  few friends of mine and myself have experienced headaches from being too close to a wifi antenna, whether it be on a router or a cell phone. Shielding the router or reducing the antenna power seem to solve the problem. I've gotten headaches just from talking on a cell phone with the device next to my ear. This is one of the reasons I use a wired headset."
"My boyfriend usually isn't emotionally open, but sometimes he does open up about things that bother or hurt him. I've always took it as a sign of closeness when he does open up. I wasn't ever turned on by it (that would be weird), but I wasn't turned off.

I understand the need to be attracted, but do you really mean that if you thought you could get a hotter woman, you wouldn't care if either women's personality? Not even in a LTR setting?"

"Actually, the more I think about it, I'm leaning towards an Impossible Girl 2: Electric Boogaloo scenario happening with Danny. 

His conscience was contained within a Matrix Slice (that's what the Nethersphere was) and we know that Gallifrey has survived in a supposedly inaccessible pocket dimension. What if the Nethersphere wasn't shutting down when he sent that final message - what if it was transmitting its stored data to the main Matrix on Gallifrey (or to the closest proxy - the TARDIS data core)? Missy would have been actively preventing this while working on it, since we see several scenes where she's plugged herself in to greet new arrivals personally. But after she was thwarted, nothing would have kept the slice from going through a regular maintenance cycle and attempting to upload the 'data'. After that point, Danny's a ghost in the machine, quite literally. The question then becomes, how does he get out?

We already know Danny has at least one descendent who looks just like him, and possibly more (it's unclear whether Kai Blue is a descendent of Danny Pink, but it's heavily implied, and we don't get a good look at him before he dies but he also superficially resembles Danny). If Danny was uploaded into Gallifrey's Matrix, it might be possible it has a similar effect on the time stream as when Clara threw herself into the Doctor's timeline.

Of course, I could just be heavily overthinking this whole thing, and the whole scenario is as simple as, ""The writers screwed up."""
"I think one factor people forget is that people are going to keep banning certain things until they get a feel on how to play against it. It's not so much it's op, it's that people haven't assembled strategies to counter it yet so it's hard to play against it.

That isn't always the case but it can make things look stronger than they really are. I do actually think Skarner/Garen do not fall under this case, but the rest do.

"I don't care about the unemployed in the sense you do.

"That's a tough one. On one hand, you would have a heck of a RB core when he comes back in Forsett, Gore, and Bell. On the other hand you would be losing a pretty decent WR.

"I don't think that minimum wage is enough to support a family of four, nor do I think it was meant for that. Minimum wage is meant for getting on your feet. Then you move up from there. Raising the minimum wage is only going to hurt the people at and near the bottom because the prices for everything from the milk and bread you buy at the store to tvs at Best Buy all have the cost of labor built in. If you raise the minimum wage, you're just raising the poverty line with it. The benefits of having more money are relegated by higher commodity prices. "

I cant link it at the moment but its on my channel description. I can pm you it when I can home if you want."
"Yeah, caster Jinx is about doing absurd damage with W + R (GB, LW, ER, Lucidity, Muramana). :)

I think the main issue is going to be your build path. Standard build can spike in DPS after one item (IE), while this build takes 2-3 items to really get going. I could possibly see this working in a super passive game where there's a ton of farming involved, but if you're behind, this build is going to take too long to ramp up, and if you're ahead, you're missing out on an early power spike to solidify that lead.

I do love this idea though. The BotRK + Runaan's synergy is always nice when the enemy has a team that likes to clump, especially with the splash on Fishbones. 

However, from your math, it looks like you need to have three targets to outpace a standard build in raw DPS. Raw DPS isn't the be-all-end-all, though, since you want to be prioritizing your damage. Killing one enemy champion faster is preferable to dealing more damage to two, I think, since a dead champion can't output DPS or CC: we need to look at the opportunity cost and relative team DPS. When you eliminate a source of DPS or CC, your team gains an advantage. This is why assassins can be incredibly valuable to a team: a dead champion doesn't contribute to their team. So while your DPS on three targets may be higher, the enemy team's DPS is relatively higher since your damage is spread out and enemies can live a bit longer.

That being said, a team that thrives on sustained fights would love an AoE Jinx I think. A Karma for team shields, an Orianna to pull people into Jinx's Runaan's range, a couple strong tanky initiators (Wu, Zac, Sej, Amumu, etc.), and you've got a nice looking team that doesn't have to worry too much about protecting Jinx since she's at max rocket range.

With the way League has been going with its patches, we may start to see Marksman become more of a supporting DPS role that facilitates other roles to shine (perhaps the rise of Runaan's Ashe to aid juggernauts!)."

"Very nice post! I can totally relate, I have been through such a similar experience. Competitive online gaming is part of what drove my addiction as well. What you said about diminishing returns makes a lot sense to me.

"I'll second this. Follow the link in /u/TheFallenPhoenix's post for some really solid information regarding your BOFF ability layouts. 

As a primary Eclipse pilot myself I would endorse flying a Beam Array setup. It's easier to keep enemies on your side than in front of the Eclipse and should give you a boost to your overall average dps; though it is all in your preferred play style and preference.

I'm not sure how your faction reputations look but as already said, replacing most of your consoles with fleet/rep consoles is a solid step towards higher dps. 

Browsing some of the builds on this subreddit can also give you a good idea of where to gear towards."
"But it's still Microsoft. And one of it's DLCs cost 1000 points. I'd say that alone is fair.

"Most likely, Boots. Clean, sturdy, boots. High heels accentuate femininity, sturdy boots accentuate the masculinity. Mainly because they impress an aura of power. 

 Cowboy boots if your lady is into them, but clean combat or work boots should work for the ladies. At least that is the more direct analogy. "
"The risk of expulsion is not worth it in my opinion. That would be your whole academic career out the window.

This makes me think even less of your TA. He knows damn well that the professors consider it cheating, yet he's offering to the students like someone trying to give me chocolate (I really love chocolate). 

You gotta do what you gotta do, but be very careful. I know personally that grad school can be hard as hell, but it's worth the hard knocks. "

"Estimating $400 / month per adult, not including restaurants?

What groceries, beer, wine, cleaning supplies add up to $13 / day?

Note: if you are drinking a daily $13 bottle of wine, that's $400 / month right there. When I am being thrifty, I get six glasses from a bottle of Three-Buck Chuck, so about fifty cents per day."
"""The term ""adverse possession,” sometimes referred to as ""squatter's rights,"" refers to a situation where title to real property is acquired without compensation by virtue of open and continuous use of the property in a manner conflicting with the true owner's rights for a specified length of time.  In the example above, though you didn’t pay anything extra for the partial lot, your use of the property conflicted with your neighbor’s use of the property for several years.  You adversely possessed his property"""
"I would try to get as reliable a RB as you can in the first round, because they are going to be more valuable, and later RBs have too many question marks to rely on.  Other than that the only change I'd make to my strategy is to potentially put more value on a top tier QB, since passing TDs are worth 6."
"The environments are still separate. The XB1 players are still in a ""testing"" environment. They will likely join the production environment with the next major patch. Just a guess. ALD is currently #2 in XB1 after a brief stint at #7 and some deep turmoil.

"Wait... What exactly are you guys given when your wisdom teeth are pulled out?

I mean, I got my wisdom teeth pulled out about a week ago. All we use in my country is local anesthesia, my jaw was numb for couple of hours but I was good to drive home straigth from the dentist by myself. Didn't even have much pain afterwards and only took one painkiller at the evening.

Was this some bigger operation or what?

"Follow up question. Why did God have to send his son to die to forgive our sins in the first place? Why not just forgive all sins and be done with it?

Also from what I know about God and satan, god seems to be much more evil than satan. God killed nearly everyone on earth in the flood and sends angels to kill people, while satan pretty much only chose to worship himself which really doesn't sound bad in any context. Do you think that satan might actually be god and god (satan) has tricked us into following his word so that he would have more followers?"
"If you want to put in extra work, there are a bunch of things with rebates. You just have to send them in after you buy it. For example, if patience is a virtue, I got 16GB of DDR3 RAM for $20. There were sold separately with mcafee antivirus. You have to install mcaffee on a computer and send in confirmation code with the rebate. So I bought two, one for me and in my fiancé's name and shipped to two different addresses. Got them and created a system restore point, then installed the mcaffee to get the code. I had to sign up for mcaffee auto renew and give a credit card, so I bought two prepaid cards and used those. I got and then Submitted the code into their rebate system and once I got confirmation, I restored to the previous point so that shitty software wasn't on my computer. Did that with another old computer I had and got two rebates, $70 each. This my RAM was $20. 

My fiancé doesn't think it was worth all that effort. "
"The Giftcard/Serve process is a pain but spending to get the point bonus is like free money. Usually you can get $2-400 of value/statement credits per credit card. Then they have intangibles like free rental car insurance, airport lounges, or free nights stay at a hotel etc etc. Some people do the Giftcard/Serve thing so they can meet minimum spend and some do it to generate points. The min spend rarely goes over $3000 over 3 months. "
"El-X are pretty sweet - I'm on my third pair. Also wearing out my final pair of Seeyas... feel your pain - (they're a great shoe).

El-X are super low profile, and a wee bit more snug than Seeyas. They can get a bit hot on hot days and are more prone to stink. They're a really good shoe though IMO and if you're wanting to go a bit more minimal they're the choice from the VFF range. "

"This scenario did not make me change my mind about humans instantly as you're implying, nor do I judge the actions of one person to represent everyone. I was rather implying it is becoming more evident in our society and that bothers me as a Canadian. You're right, humans can act like pieces of garbage, and you could surely agree it is only getting worse... I've seen the good sides of humanity too, as I work in Health Care. My point is, why can't we strive for it to always be getting better and try to fix what is broken.

I think it's moronic to say ""deal with it"". It's that type of lazy attitude that allows this type of behaviour to be pushed further in the direction of ""normal"" in our society, rather than saying let's do something about it. Imagine if you were the victim of someone yelling for you to go back to your country and that he was going to murder your children. Maybe in the future you won't be so quick to attack but rather ask for clarity."
"I was in a single car accident and was almost pronounced dead.  My dad and I were moving to another state answer had been driving almost 14 hours when I fell asleep and drove straight into a stoplight pole at 55mph.  A nurse was driving behind me on her way to work.  She told me later that she was the first to reach me and I didn't have a pulse for at least 5 minutes.  She said my dad came running back to my car and she told him I was dead.  She said he started yelling my name and I suddenly woke up.

TL;DR I wrecked a car, didn't have a pulse for over 5 minutes, my dad yelled my name, I woke up."
"Use a pair of clippers to get it close, then I use a generic Gillette knockoff razor from Sam's. I shave my head in the shower, start by washing with normal body wash or bar soap, which i prefer. After it's clean, get some cream and lather that shit. Now, grab the razor, and starting from the middle of  your forehead, start shaving over your head. Just go straight back, up and over. To give you a midline. Pick a side you want to shave first, and start moving the razor closer to that side when you start your next pass. I use my off hand to align the razor with the midline of my last pass. Do this for both sides. 

For the back of your head and neck, i like to go up along my spine and then to the sides, same procedure as for the top, align the razor, and take each half at a time. Be careful around the ears, i usually add more cream, and shave toward the ear, cut myself too many times trying to start at the ear and go away. Check the ears when you're done and out of the shower. Its easy to miss some hair by the junction with the side burns.

Once you think you are done, wash off the cream and wash your head again with some kind of mild soap. Bar soap works well here... I use dial. If you use aftershave, go for it. I'm a cheap grad student, and i just put some 70%isopropyl alcohol on my palms, and slick my skull with that. Don't cry, let it evaporate, and then put some moisturizer on your nice and smooth head.

Final step, feel badass."
"I think they worst part was the lie. And I mean, I'm a person too, I lie sometimes. But if I would have asked her, and she panicked and lied, I almost would have understood. But she brought it up out of nowhere."
"It's a way to make things difficult, but a terrible way, to say the least.

There are challenging things you can do better and better with practice, like GWD solo Woox style prayer flicking, Zulrah by memorizing the rotations and the correct times to eat etc. and even at smoke devil boss you can practice walking in the correct way to not miss ticks and to get hit as few times as possible.

My problem is in how my eyes see colors differently as a result of repeated retina surgeries, and I can't overcome this with practice. I'm currently doing Cerberus with an eye patch over my left eye. It somewhat fixes the problem for me, but for actually colorblind people or just others with issues similar to mine this kind of thing is just not good gameplay.

Besides, I bet some non-Jagex client could just add overlay melee, range and mage icons on the ghosts, completely negating any ""difficulty"" gained with this type of design."
"i just got off from playing in squads for 2 hours straight and i only encountered 2 truly laggy players, and they weren't even THAT laggy. hell, one of them wasn't even japanese, either your internet sucks or you're having bad luck. just take a break of the game. no need to overreact and quit."
"The issue is that Yacht Club agreed to this. They decided it was fine to keep content away from other people who bought the game. Ps4 and X1 have small exclusive content which is fine, but now Nintendo gets an entire game mode exclusive. And what about the PC gamers who originally funded it? Nothing that isn't coming to all systems anyways."
"Mida will still have its uses IMO. The movement perk alone almost outweighs the damage shortcomings it might have going into y2. Great for moving around the dreadnaught on foot patrol, and can swap out for something else when necessary. Besides, enough complaints from the community, and I'm sure Bungie will listen. I also don't doubt that there will be other armor or weapons that will have speed perks on them at some point. We've now got burn resist armors coming our way, so anything is possible. Bungie also loves reusing stuff. I've noticed hammer forged has returned as a perk with tTK, something that was removed with HoW. "
"But before you would have to do that every 40s now you can just have to do it at the start and end of an upgrade, not to mention all the times when you'll just leave it on the nexis (in the early game) or a robo (in the late game).

This seems a lot easier to me. "

Jenner Benner told me. Cultural backwater: It's not New York City Brisbane? Yes Brisbane. Cultural backwater now with brackenwater? Yes Brackenwater. Over a 6-7 year period, 45,000 millionaire chinekes from China were allowed to immigrate to Canada (100% ended up in Vancouver). A city with a 610,000 person population, overrun by psychopathic millionaire chinekes. The idea was that these arriving Asians would provide jobs and prop up the economy with their wealth. Nah. They use Vancouver to launder money. The city sees none of the cash outside of the initial home buy. Guess who pays higher taxes in Vancouver: The Chineke with 12.3 million in the bank, or the Canadian living outside the city? It's the Canadian who can't afford to life in chinekes central (Vancouver). Hint: The Chineke millionaires pay less taxes than refugees. The average price of a house in Vancouver is over a million, for a tear down in the worst part of the city. Chinekes buy land up and build, build build. Empty dwellings.

BUT SYDNEY? YES LIKE SYDNEY. BC is a chineKe owned money laundering operation. In 30 years when you will only find chinekes faces who can't speak English in the city of Vancouver, I will laugh. And while all of this is going on, not a single policitian will do a consensus to determine what portion of the Vancouver and immediate surrounding areas is Chinekes or Chinekes owned. Fucking pathetic, Canada bowing down and fucking its own citizens over to make a bunch of Chinekes millionaires (and billionaires) happy, all for a few scraps of a couple thousand per millionaire.

When I told him he was demonstrably wrong about guns/death, he retorted with the Harvard study that Bloomberg helped fund. I threw the Pew research study w/ data from the FBI, CDC &amp; DoJ right back at him. Silence. 

After gun owners called him out he suddenly had to go but ""couldn't reply to all comments"" though he vowed he was going to keep approving them to show how crazy we are. How'd that workout? HAHAHA. "

"You do realize that the dinosaur depicted in Jurassic Park is the *Pachycephalosaurus,* which sounds like ""Paki"" but isn't based on a racial slur? Translated, it means ""thick headed lizard."" 

There *is* a species of dinosaur known scientifically as the *Pakisaurus* because its fossils were discovered in Pakistan. Dinosaurs are often named after the places where they were first discovered. For example, the *Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis* was named after the Mamenchi Ferry station where it was first found, as well as the Hochuan County where the second one was found. As FFGFM pointed out, the Nigersaurus was named after Niger, where it was originally found.
